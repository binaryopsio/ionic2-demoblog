# BinaryOps Demo

This is an ionic 2 application that shows a simple implementation of the demo API of binaryOps.
Ionic 2 is still in beta, so things could change. We will attempt to keep everything up to date.

The app uses the angular2-binaryops package installed through npm [https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-binaryops](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-binaryops)
When you create your own application based on a [BinaryOps.io](https://binaryops.io) API, you can of course start from this project and modify it as needed. Or you can start from scratch with a new ionic 2 project, in which case you'll need to add the reference to angular2-binaryops to your package.json file.

## About the application.
The application is a very plain and simple app that shows a few blogs with a few posts each. you get to add, edit and delete comments from the posts, which make actual requests on the API. You'll need to go to the login page first, the supplied defaults work. ( We clean things up periodically to remove any unwanted content, as per our own discretion.)

We provide this application to show a simple implementation, as a reference for developers. We will be expanding it over time to show implementations of all the features of [BinaryOps.io](https://binaryops.io)
